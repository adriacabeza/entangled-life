This game was inspired by the fascinating world of mushrooms and their complex interactions, as explored in the book 
"Entangled Life." Get ready to embark on a ferocious battle through mycelial networks while honing your coding 
skills. Players take on the roles of myceliums trying to look for food and expand by traversing a map with other
rival players. 

This game was inspired by the TODO

## Coding Challenges
The coding challenges in Entangled Life will include: 

- Implementing algorithms to make your mycelial growth and nutrient distribution.
- Block your rivals possibilities by limiting their reachable zone.
